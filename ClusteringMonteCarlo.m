% ClusteringMonteCarlo.m
% Simulated clustering of oligomers given a pairwise interaction potential
% Westley W. Wu, Noah H. Somberg, Mei Hong
% Written in MATLAB R2021b
% July 2022
% This script takes a specified number of pores and places them randomly on
% a 1000 A x 1000 A area. It then applies the interaction potential and
% simulates with a Metropolis Monte Carlo method. The interaction potential
% is read from the file 'interaction_potential.txt'. This simulation uses
% periodic boundary conditions and outputs the final coordinates of the
% center of each oligomer in 'finalCenters.csv'
